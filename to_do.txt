manually inspect all positive data samples in plot view with peak detection

compare with a robust variety of other samples

#clean up initial peak indexes in peak detection


revisit the peak cancelors 
- how are high amp peaks chosen.... manual inspection may yield a hard limit to use on DWT sigs vice a value on baseline which could be insignificant on good sigs
- revist peak width calcs
- revisit / document false peaks (mirrors?) in code

pulse train cancellation may not be correct


















rerun feature extraction for train (and test why not?)

rerun analysis with varying train test split monte carlos with new extracted features to see resilience against cherry picking

goal is consistent MCC > 0.5 for next submission

work in VSB_Final Notebook and elsewhere?
